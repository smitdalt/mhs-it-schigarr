# Welcome to your Repository

1. To get started, find the green button labeled "Clone or download" and click on it
2. Ensure the dropdown modal says "Clone with HTTPS" and copy the provided link
3. Next, hit the windows key on your laptop, type "git bash" and hit enter
4. Once the git command line opens, you can clone the repository using the command `git clone <repository-url>`, where "\<repository-url>" is the link you copied during step 2
5. Next, you will need to change directories to the newly copied code from github. To do this type `cd mhs-it-<your-mhs-username>` in the git command window
6. Finally, you will need to open this folder up in vscode to edit the website. One easy way to do this is to type `code .` in the command window. Another way is to open Visual Studio Code through the windows start menu and open the folder directly from the "File" menu

## Have Fun!
